ABOUT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mupen64Plus's Rice Video plugin supports a very nice feature which allows the
user to replace all of the original textures used for 3D rendering in a game
with high-resolution replacement textures drawn by graphic artists.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enable Hi-Res Texture Loading in Rice Video
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to begin using the hi-resolution texture feature, you must enable it
by editing the Mupen64Plus config file. One option is to find the file and edit
it directly with a text editor. On Linux or OSX, this is located at: "~/.config/
mupen64plus/", and on Windows it is in the "Application Data" sub-folder of
your user folder. On Windows XP and prior, this is "C:\Documents and Settings\
<username>\Application Data\Mupen64Plus\", while on Windows Vista and newer
this is "C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Mupen64Plus". You should find a section in
this file labeled [Video-Rice], and within this section is a parameter called
LoadHiResTextures. Set this to True to enable searching for and loading high-
resolution textures.

Another option to enable this feature is to use the --set option with the
Mupen64Plus command-line user interface. To do this, run a game with a command
similar to this:

./mupen64plus --set Video-Rice[LoadHiResTextures]=True --saveoptions m64p_test_rom.v64

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installing Hi-Res Texture Files
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install a high-resolution texture pack for a game, all that you need to do
is unzip the archive and put the extracted directory full of images into the
right place. On Linux and OSX, this is usually "/home/<username>/.local/share/
mupen64plus/hires_texture". On Windows it is in the "Application Data" sub-
folder of your user folder. On Windows XP and prior, this is "C:\Documents and
Settings\<username>\Application Data\Mupen64Plus\hires_texture", while on
Windows Vista and newer this is "C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Mupen64Plus\
   hires_texture". If this directory doesn't exist, create it and copy the
hi-res texture directory inside.

The folder containing hi-res textures must be named exactly the same as the
ROM's name in the header of the ROM file. Usually this name is short with all
capital letters, like "MARIOKART64" or "SMASH BROTHERS". The command-line UI
prints out this ROM name when running a game, right after the Goodname and
before the MD5.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After setup, just run the game as usual. If using the command-line UI, you should
see a line printed out which says:

Video: Texture loading option is enabled. Finding all hires textures


N64 game
        0 = RGBA
        1 = YUV
        2 = CI
        3 = IA
        4 = I
    part 4: Texture size in N64 game
        0 = 4 bit
        1 = 8 bit
        2 = 16 bit
        3 = 32 bit
    part 5: dumpped texture format
        rgb = 24 bit RGB format
        a   = 24 bit alpha channel only in 24 bit RGB intensity
        all = 32 bit RGB format
        ci  = color indexed (BMP) format
    extension:
        PNG
        BMP

5. How to make your own hi-rez textures
   a. The hi-rez texture size could be 2, 3 or 4 times as the orginal N64 texture size
   b. Don't use other customerized texture sizes
   c. If the original texture has alpha channel, you MUST also provide the alpha channel by
      - Use *_all.png 32bit format
      - use both *_rgb and *_a files to provide RGB and alpha separately
   d. Color indexed textures must be prepared in color indexed format, not in RGB/A format
   e. Instead of *_rgb.png and *_a.png, you can provide your textures in *_rgb.bmp and *_a.bmp.
      BMP files are uncompressed, can be loaded faster
   f. *_rgb.png, *_a.png, *_rgb.bmp, *_a.bmp must be provided in 24 bit RGB format, not in other
      formats. Alpha *_a.* files must be 24 bit, only in 2 bit or 8 bit
   g. Filename must be kept the same as the original dumped texture filenames
